# URC in stackoverfow

In this project, we are using the dataset “datascience.stackexchange.com” from the Stackoverflow
data dump and after performing some operations and manual labeling, we created our dataset
“python_comments_posts.csv”.We are using the “comments_1221.csv” file for testing which was 
created by the authors of the original paper.

All the datasets we have used are available in the dataset folder. It is required to download all the 
datasets.

 Although Posts.csv and Comments.csv are created by running the code, we have kept those files 
in the dataset folder as well.Python_comments_posts.csv file is created using the dataset.ipynb
code and after downloading we performed manual labeling and added extra columns. We have 
put the modified python_comments_posts.csv file in the dataset.

To run the code, the path of the specified dataset in every ipynb file must be changed and required 
libraries must be imported.
